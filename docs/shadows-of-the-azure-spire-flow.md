# Shadows of the Azure Spire — Encounter Flow

The Azure Spire is the diplomatic tower that keeps four rival banners from open war. Councilor Vael—the public face of the spire—secretly funnels mirror-forged weapons to foreign armies through a shadow cabal led by the unseen Archon Ryell. Spymaster Kaela has proof of tampered wards and mirrored messenger doubles, but she cannot openly accuse the council without spark­ing civil war. The player’s strike team must gather leverage, pick an infiltration route, and expose the cabal before the spire’s mirror nexus seals and erases the evidence.

### Stakes at a Glance
- **Why infiltrate?** If Vael and Ryell finish attuning the mirror heart, they can rewrite scrying reports and frame whole cities for treason. Borders will burn overnight.
- **Why secrecy?** Every banner has envoys inside the spire; a direct assault would look like a coup. Subtlety buys Kaela time to line up proof.
- **What leverage matters?** Disabling pylons, sabotaging forges, or seizing vault ledgers gives concrete bargaining chips during the confrontation so the council cannot hand-wave accusations.

### Key Faces
- **Spymaster Kaela:** Former archivist elevated after unmasking double agents; now mission handler who provides intel and weighs how much truth to report in the aftermath.
- **Councilor Vael:** Charismatic facade of the spire, actually the cabal’s mouthpiece.
- **Archon Ryell:** The mirror architect embedded inside the heart chamber. Might be swayed if convinced a worse threat looms.

Players uncover these truths organically: a courier letter reaches you days before the spire, explaining why Kaela needs neutral champions and teaching the \"Broken Prism, Unbroken Oath\" passphrase; Kaela intercepts you at the war camp and repeats it, and the envoys later require you to speak the code again before trusting any infiltration plan. The pavilion briefing references the letter’s authority, the tense war-camp interlude reveals how every banner is fraying, envoys debate tactics during the council scene, and each infiltration route includes moments to pause, observe, and hear how the mirrors have warped daily life. After the Mirror Heart reveal, a Council Reckoning scene lets you (or Kaela) present the proof before the final aftermath report. With that context, the encounter flow below shows how the intel-gathering phase, the branching infiltrations, and the finale interact.

## Branch Notes

- **Skybridge Route** – Focuses on athletics/airborne maneuvers and leverages class- or ancestry-specific options to neutralize the pylons in `aerie-overlook`. If players succeed here, they earn an explosive option in the finale.
- **Underworks Route** – Navigating valves and smugglers culminates at `ember-forge`, letting players threaten the spire’s supply lines inside the Mirror Heart.
- **Masquerade Route** – Social intrigue at `gala-vault` yields proof that can be broadcast to the ballroom, flipping the crowd during the confrontation.

Regardless of route, every branch explicitly feeds into `mirror-heart`, then `aftermath`, ensuring there are no dead ends and that each choice provides unique leverage in the climax.
