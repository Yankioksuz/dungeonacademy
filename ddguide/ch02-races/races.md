# Races

A structured reference for the core ancestries in the D&D Player’s Basic Rules.

## Dwarf
> “Yer late, elf!” came the rough edge of a familiar voice. Bruenor Battlehammer walked up the back of his dead foe, disregarding the fact that the heavy monster lay on top of his elven friend. In spite of the added discomfort, the dwarf’s long, pointed, often-broken nose and gray-streaked though still-fiery red beard came as a welcome sight to Drizzt. “Knew I’d find ye in trouble if I came out an’ looked for ye!” —R. A. Salvatore, The Crystal Shard

### Overview
Kingdoms rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the roots of mountains, echoing mines and blazing forges, a commitment to clan and tradition, and a burning hatred of goblins and orcs—these threads unite all dwarves.

### Appearance
Bold and hardy, dwarves stand well under 5 feet but are broad and compact, often weighing as much as a human nearly two feet taller. Skin tones range from deep brown to pale red-tinged hues, with common shades of light brown or deep tan. Hair is usually black, gray, or brown; paler dwarves often have red hair. Male dwarves value their beards highly and groom them carefully.

### Perspective and Temperament
Dwarves can live more than 400 years, granting them a long memory and a different perspective from shorter-lived races. They are solid and enduring, respecting clan traditions tracing back to ancient strongholds. Devotion to their gods reinforces ideals of industrious labor and skill in battle. Determined and loyal, they are slow to forget wrongs and may turn a single feud into a clan conflict.

### Society and Clans
Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath mountains where they mine gems and precious metals and forge wonders. They love precious metals and jewelry, sometimes to the point of avarice, and gain wealth through trade (often delegating water routes to humans and halflings). The clan is the central unit of society; to be clanless is the worst fate. Outside their homelands, dwarves are typically artisans—especially smiths, armorers, and jewelers—or mercenaries and bodyguards.

### Faith and Motives for Adventure
Dwarves might adventure for treasure, divine inspiration, or to bring glory to their gods. Clan concerns often motivate them: restoring honor, avenging ancient wrongs, earning a place after exile, or reclaiming a lost ancestral weapon.

### Relations with Other Races
- **Elves:** “It’s not wise to depend on the elves. No telling what an elf will do next... Not as good as a dwarf, maybe, but no doubt they hate the orcs as much as we do.”
- **Halflings:** “Sure, they’re pleasant folk... How can you take them seriously?”
- **Humans:** “You take the time to get to know a human, and by then the human’s on her deathbed... You have to admire that kind of dedication, even if it gets them in trouble more often than not.”

## Elf
> “I have never imagined such beauty existed,” Goldmoon said softly... The elven city opened its arms lovingly to the wilderness. —Margaret Weis & Tracy Hickman, Dragons of Autumn Twilight

### Overview
Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it. They dwell in places of ethereal beauty—ancient forests or silvery spires glittering with faerie light—where music drifts and gentle fragrances fill the air. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry.

### Appearance
With unearthly grace and fine features, elves appear hauntingly beautiful. They stand from just under 5 feet to just over 6 feet and have slender builds (100–145 pounds). Skin tones include human shades plus copper, bronze, and bluish-white; hair can be green or blue; eyes may look like liquid gold or silver. They favor elegant clothing in bright colors and simple, lovely jewelry.

### Outlook and Longevity
Elves can live well over 700 years, giving them a broad view of events. They are often amused and curious, remaining aloof from petty concerns yet relentless when pursuing a goal. Flexible like young branches, they prefer diplomacy and patience but reveal stern martial skill when needed.

### Society and Realms
Most elves live in small forest villages hidden among the trees, supporting themselves through hunting, gathering, and magic without clearing land. They craft fine clothes and art, trading crafted goods for metals. Outside their lands, elves are commonly traveling minstrels, artists, or sages; nobles seek elf instructors for swordplay or magic. Though sometimes haughty, elves are generally gracious and can find good in most people.

### Exploration and Adventure
Elves adventure from wanderlust, enjoying centuries of discovery. They dislike regimented but ever-shifting human societies, so they choose careers that let them travel freely. Many pursue martial prowess or magical power, join rebels against oppression, or champion moral causes.

### Relations with Other Races
- **Dwarves:** “Dwarves are dull, clumsy oafs... their best smiths produce art that approaches elven quality.”
- **Halflings:** “Halflings are people of simple pleasures... they have proven themselves tougher than they seem.”
- **Humans:** “All that haste... if only they could slow down and learn some refinement.”

#### The Darkness of the Drow
Most drow society, devoted to the spider-goddess Lolth, is cruel and treacherous. They believe surface races exist only as slaves. The famed ranger Drizzt Do’Urden stands as a rare exception, proving that drow can choose another path.

## Halfling
> Regis the halfling... locked his fingers behind his head and leaned back against the mossy blanket of the tree trunk. —R.A. Salvatore, The Crystal Shard

### Overview
Halflings seek the comforts of home: peace far from marauding monsters, a blazing fire, generous meals, fine drink, and conversation. Some live in remote agricultural communities; others roam in nomadic bands, loving the open road while keeping hearth and home close to the heart.

### Appearance and Practicality
Standing about 3 feet tall and weighing 40–45 pounds, halflings appear harmless and survive by avoiding notice or offense. Skin ranges from tan to pale with a ruddy cast; hair is usually brown or sandy and wavy; eyes are brown or hazel. Men often wear long sideburns; beards and mustaches are rare. They prefer simple, comfortable clothes in bright colors and keep treasures secured rather than displayed.

### Personality
Halflings are affable and cheerful, cherishing family and friendship. They dream more of community than of gold or glory, and even adventurers are driven by curiosity, wanderlust, or loyalty.

### Society
Most halflings live in small, peaceful communities with large farms and groves. They have little interest in kingdoms or nobility, relying on family elders and tradition. Many live among other races, valued for hard work and loyalty. Some travel by wagon or boat, maintaining no permanent home.

### Adventuring Outlook
Halflings adventure to defend their communities, aid friends, or explore the world. For them, adventuring is often an opportunity or necessity rather than a career.

### Relations with Other Races
- **Dwarves:** “Dwarves make loyal friends... But would it hurt them to smile once in a while?”
- **Elves:** “They’re so beautiful... but there’s no telling what’s going on behind their smiling faces.”
- **Humans:** “Humans are a lot like us... By protecting their own lands, they protect us as well.”

## Human
> These were the stories of a restless people who long ago took to the seas and rivers in longboats... —Elaine Cunningham, Daughter of the Drow

### Overview
Humans are the youngest common race, arriving late on the world scene and short-lived compared to dwarves, elves, and dragons. Perhaps because of their shorter lives, they strive to achieve as much as they can, building mighty empires on conquest and trade. They are innovators, achievers, and pioneers.

### Variety and Ambition
Humans are physically diverse, standing 5–6+ feet and weighing 125–250 pounds, with skin from nearly black to very pale and hair from black to blond. Many have nonhuman ancestry. They reach adulthood in their late teens and rarely live a century. Adaptable and opportunistic, humans stay alert to changing political and social dynamics. They found lasting institutions—temples, governments, libraries, and laws—to preserve traditions beyond any single lifetime.

### Exemplars of Drive
Adventuring humans are among the boldest of an already daring race, seeking glory through power, wealth, and fame. They often champion causes rather than territories.

### Relations with Other Races
- **Dwarves:** “They’re stout folk, stalwart friends, and true to their word. Their greed for gold is their downfall, though.”
- **Elves:** “It’s best not to wander into elven woods... you’ll as likely be bewitched as peppered with arrows.”
- **Halflings:** “It’s hard to beat a meal in a halfling home... If halflings had a shred of ambition, they might really amount to something.”
